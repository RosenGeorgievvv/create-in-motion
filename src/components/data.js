      "Rwanda and Burundi are the second and third of five countries featured in a journey called Around Lake Victoria.These two small nations, standing off the beaten tourist path, offer an authentic African experience, blessed with dramatic landscapes, rich biodiversity, and lakeside communities, each with its unique culture and a tragic history stained by brutal ethnic conflicts. Rwanda is healing the wounds of the 1994 genocide and transforming into a model of national unity and economic prosperity. From the Genocide Memorial in the pristine capital Kigali, along its impeccable roads, to the fishing villages around Lake Kivu and Nyungwe Forest National Park—home to Africa's oldest tropical forest, situated at the watershed between the Congo River basin to the west and the Nile River basin to the east.Burundi, meanwhile, is plagued by conflict, with poverty as the norm for all but a few. From Lake Tanganyika and the capital Bujumbura—surprisingly boasting refined restaurants and chic nightclubs—to Rusizi National Park and the site where journalist Henry Morton Stanley met explorer David Livingstone and uttered the iconic phrase,Dr. Livingstone, I presume?—Burundi offers a compelling mix of history and culture. Add to that the village of Gishora, where the captivating performances of the former royal drummers continue to enchant visitors.",

      "Arabia Felix - the Happy Arabia, as the Romans called Yemen. The land of hospitality, milk, and honey is no longer an attractive destination for travelers today. But despite the civil war, hardships, and uncertain conditions, I managed to visit the places that the Queen of Sheba once called home and where Gilgamesh sought the key to eternal life. From the fortified villages in the rocks, I watched the cultivated plains. I strolled through the shaded streets of Shibam - the Manhattan of the desert, and its multi-story mudbrick towers testified to the construction skills of the ancient Yemeni craftsmen. I had to be cautious and be protected, to watch what I said to the qat traders and the representatives of the warring factions. That is how I reached the Gulf of Aden and the city of Al Mukalla, and the wild coastline to the east won me over forever. I will remember the authentic taste of Arabia. The people of Yemen and their rich history and culture certainly deserve more than the tragedy they are experiencing right now."

      "In ancient times, when America and Africa were part of a single continent, strange mountain plateaus formed, rising high above the surrounding landscape. Today, the jungle covering the land all around is home to the Pemón Indians, who believe that spirits called Mawari live at the peaks. They refer to these flat mountains as tepuis. They also call them islands in the sky. I decided to wander through the lands of the Pemón and meet their spirits somewhere in the southeastern part of Venezuela, where Canaima National Park is located. This is the home of the iconic tepuis with flat tops, which inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World. An unreal place, where the world’s highest waterfall, Angel Falls (Salto Ángel), drops from nearly a kilometer in height. Climbing Mount Roraima was a must. It is said to be one of the best hiking routes in South America. I added a boat trip through the Orinoco Delta and encounters with the Warrau Indians, whose way of life is far from our own. To finish, I needed to unwind on Isla Margarita. After all, life in the jungle is tough... The itinerary was set. So, with a group of friends, I wandered through Venezuela...",

From the Pashtun city of Peshawar to the Gilgit-Baltistan province, blessed with incredible ethnic diversity and natural beauty. I lived with the people of the Hunza Valley, drank tea on the Fairy Meadows beneath Nanga Parbat, and climbed to the base camp of the peak. I traveled the Karakoram Highway and reached the Khunjerab Pass at the border with China. I saw the majestic Indus River and the place where the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalayas—Earth's three tallest mountain ranges—meet.Satisfied, I returned home.It was a memorable journey.The year continues.Is there a desire for more...?",

I met wonderful people, gazing at their ruined future as my plane took off from Kabul.The unthinkable happened. Or perhaps the inevitable. Time reveals all secrets. A tragedy for everything and everyone there, a tragedy for the hopes that were crushed.",

They dived with us too. Fate was kind—we got exactly what we deeply wished for!Before heading home, we introduced ourselves to Oslo, glowing in Christmas lights.The year continues, and there’s still time for more...Other stories await to be written in the New Year, 2022.",

After skiing, you can enjoy roasted northern reindeer, bear meat, or salmon.When the cold makes rocks, trees, and even foundation crack, only Scandinavian and Russian beauties—real ones!—brave the slopes. Meanwhile, the guys in the après-ski bars pay them no attention and get drunk early—really drunk! There are plenty of saunas, and the reindeer outnumber the people.Continuing the ski vacation: A Lapland tour on snowmobiles—priceless. Snowmobiles make it easy to access other unique activities: dog sledding, climbing frozen waterfalls, and cruising with icebreakers. Accommodation is far from civilization, perfect for watching the Northern Lights.For the grand finale: Museums, fancy restaurants, and bars in Helsinki.",
